When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks - when you don't have permission to make changes but want to tinker with the repository.
clones - when you can make changes to the repository having a direct clone can push changes directly to the repository.
branches - when you want to diviate from the master file but don't want to break the code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When adding a new feature and making sure that everything is good to go by everyone that is a part of before it goes into the working master branch.
