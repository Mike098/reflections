When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When using a different computer that you don't have your files in and don't want to store those files on that computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To make sure that your changes are logical and if they are pushed automatically it might not be a working or make sense at all.
